# GenAI Bootcamp 2025

Welcome to my **GenAI Bootcamp 2025** repository! This repo documents my **6-week journey** through the Free GenAI Bootcamp, where I’ll be learning to design, build, and deploy real-world **Generative AI applications**. This bootcamp covers key topics like **prompt engineering, AI-powered assistants, training, optimization, and production deployment**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

As part of this bootcamp, I will be building a **collection of AI-powered learning applications** designed for a **Japanese Language Learning School**. These projects aim to enhance the learning experience by leveraging Generative AI.

### **Key Projects:**
- **Daily Life Visual Novel Generator** – A dynamic storytelling app for language practice.
- **Japanese Text Adventure** – A text-based game for vocabulary and sentence structure learning.
- **Japanese Sentence Constructor** – A tool to help learners translate English phrases into Japanese.
